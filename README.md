C++ Learning Scripts

This repository is a collection of C++ scripts that I created while learning the C++ programming language. 
The scripts cover a range of topics, including basic syntax, data types, control structures, functions, classes, and more.

Getting Started

To use these scripts, you will need to have a C++ compiler installed on your computer. 
There are many options available, including GCC, Clang, and Microsoft Visual C++. 
Once you have a compiler installed, you can clone this repository to your local machine and compile the scripts using your compiler.
